#-----------------------------------
# Iterator Triggers
#-----------------------------------
All iterator triggers can use these parameters:

<list> = {
    # Filters the list down to a sub-set based on the triggers (optional)
    filter = {
        <triggers>
    }
    
    # How many elements of this list to check
    count = <int> / all
    
    # How much of the list in a percentage to check (optional)
    percent = <float>
    
    # The triggers to check for elements in this list
    <triggers>
}

The -> indicates the inner scope the iterator targets.

Note: the count parameter is what can replicate the old any/all behavior from EU4.
By default the scopes act as any scopes, returning true if there is one match. Setting the count to a number higher than 1 or to all changes this.
