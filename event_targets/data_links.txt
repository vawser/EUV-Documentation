# Contextual Data Links
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These allow you to scope to a 'data' block from the listed FROM scope.

A basic example of usage is to access a object:
    research_advance = advance_type:guilds

Without the advance_type: data link, which object the guilds refers to is ambiguous.
